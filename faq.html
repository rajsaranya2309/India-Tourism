                    <p>Two things to keep in mind while packing for India are:

1. Season : Since India experiences hot summers (in most of the parts) and chilly winters, travellers should pack according to the month they are planning a visit in. If the trip is planned in the months between March and September, carrying light woolens (in the hills) and cotton clothes (in other areas) will be enough. </p>

                    <p>While English is spoken and understood by a large number of people in India, it isnâ€™t an absolute necessity. Instead, focus on learning some Hindi words that come in use in daily lives. You can also book a tour with Tour My India that offers tour guides who are proficient in different languages and can be mediators between you and other people you encounter in the country.</p>

                    <p>The diverse topography of India comprises mountains, beaches, and deserts. The large size of the country also blesses it with different climatic conditions, which means that, while some places in India may have the mercury rising in the summers, there are some, where the weather is cool and pleasant.
